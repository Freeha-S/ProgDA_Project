# Objective

The Objective of this project is
- Choose a real-world phenomenon that can be measured and for which you could collect at least one-hundred data points across at least four diﬀerent variables. 
- Investigate the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other.
- Synthesise/simulate a data set as closely matching their properties as possible.
- Detail research and implement the simulation in a Jupyter notebook – the data set itself can simply be displayed in an output cell within the notebook.
